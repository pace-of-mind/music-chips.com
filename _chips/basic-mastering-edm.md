- [ ] Route tracks into groups (BUSes), apply [Glue Compressor](/chips/glue-compressor) if needed.

- [ ] Apply side-EQ on the master to ensure your track is mono below 100-150Hz unless intended.

- [ ] Work with slight (+/- 1dB) wide-band EQ to balance out different frequency ranges and enhance the lead instruments or voice.

- [ ] Apply a limiter to the Master to reach the industry loudness standards.

  - [ ] Enable look-ahead (5-10ms) and true peak detection (-0.1dB).

  - [ ] Drive the gain until the limiter starts peaking at 2-3dB of the gain reduction.

  - [ ] Measure the loudness with a plugin, it should be somewhere between -10...-8 LUFS integrated. You can use free [Youlean Loudness Meter plugin](https://youlean.co/youlean-loudness-meter/).

  - [ ] If you're not able to reach expected loudness, you can drive the limiter higher, but you should not go over 5dB gain reduction. If that's the case, apply individual limiters on every track bus. If this is not helping you likely need to get back to the mixing.

- [ ] Compare the track against other tracks in the album/EP, or recently released tracks to ensure consistent sound.

- [ ] Compare with the reference tracks.

- [ ] Check the track in different sound systems. Obviously, it won't sound the same everywhere, but the most important elements should be audible.

  - [ ] Basic earbuds
